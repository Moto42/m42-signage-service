# M42 Digital Signage Service
## Description
This is a simple digital signage service.

With just a few, easy steps, you can turn any monitor into a digital sign, displaying a rotating stack of slides, or a single slide.

Slideshows are built using a simple GUI in the server's administration web-app.

When you're slide-show is ready, you will be given a 'sign URL'. Open a browser on the computer you wish to use as your new digital sign, and point it to that URL.

Done! The monitor is now displaying your information.

## Signs
- I can display a sign on a monitor, by opening a browser and navigating to a specific URL.
- When a sign is being displayed, it will rotate through a series of 'slides', displaying one after another.
- - I can set the slides to appear sequentialy, or in random order.
- When a sign's page is opened, it will automaticaly go full-screen.
- - I can override this behavior with an option in the slideshow's settings.
